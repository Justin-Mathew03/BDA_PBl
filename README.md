# Big Data Analysis with PySpark on Weather Data

## Project Objective

- This project involves analyzing and extracting insights from the NCEI Global Surface Summary of Day dataset. The data will be processed using PySpark, Jupyter Notebook, and various data engineering and analytics techniques, providing hands-on experience with big data. Key tasks include handling and analyzing weather data from Cincinnati and Florida for years 2015-2024.
        
## Key Points to Remember:
-   Remove missing or invalid readings from the dataset as per the README.
-   Organize and analyze data by leveraging Spark's capabilities for handling large datasets efficiently.
-   Ensure results for all tasks are clear and well-documented in the code and output.
        

- The outcomes provide valuable insights into climate patterns over a decade, such as the frequency and intensity of high-temperature events. This project demonstrates the application of big data tools in real-world environmental data analysis and highlights the importance of distributed computing in handling and extracting meaningful information from large-scale datasets.
